Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

Python is a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

It is used for:
web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

### Applications of Python

Python can be used on a server to create web applications.

Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.

Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.

Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.

Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages

Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.

Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.

Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. 
Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
